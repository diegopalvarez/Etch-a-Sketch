# Etch-a-Sketch
In this project, I made use of JavaScript, HTML and CSS to create a simple, yet engaging experience that lets users create complex drawings using a customizable grid system.

## How to use it
1. Start by choosing a grid size using the corresponding button (the default grid is 16x16)
2. Once you hover your mouse above the grid, you will see how the tiles change to a completely random color
3. When you mouse leaves the tile, it doesn't go back to its previous state. Instead, it progressively darkens until it becomes black.

This allows you to create complex patterns and drawings. Let you imagination flow, and *enjoy*!
